This game was built for the 2018 48 hour GMTK Game Jam. All code and assets excluding those listed in the credits where constructed during the timeframe.
<br /><br />
Our submission features Adventure without Stopping - the character must move at all times - Releasing a movement key has little effect on whether the character stops. Instead,  Boofhead will continue in the direction he was sent until he hits a wall, causing damage.
<br /><br />
This fundamental shift spread to all parts of the game mechanics during development, with health tied to movement speed directly, so that players taking advantage of momentum and "flow" can survive the level with a higher score and therefore "health".
<br /><br />
This is our team's first game jam, and first game in general. We assembled on the day and built something that we're pretty proud of, combining programming, art and music design skills. There is a fairly large amount of content unreleased that we believe could be developed further.</td>
